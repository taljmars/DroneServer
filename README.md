In order to have a better understanding of the code simply dig into it. The server can be splitted to two componetns, the first, a databse deamon, responsible of saving the data for future use. It second hat is the main DroneServer deamon resposible to manage the server itself, this deamon give commmands to the DB based on requests being sent to him by external clients. The server keeps user data in private DB to work on until you save it to the public DB.
